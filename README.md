# Description
The project is about air quality index monitoring using Neural Networks where dataset"data.csv" is passed as input and the corresponding air quality is predicted by the model.

##### Dataset is availble on Github

# Installations

The requirements are provided in the requirement.txt file

# Running

AIR_QUALITY_INDEX_MONITORING.ipynb file is used to train the model using  dataset and also consits the analysis of the results with different evaluation metrics.<br />
The trained model is saved for future use 
<br />
<br />
GUI_Air.py is the code used to run the saved model.
<br />
<br />
Models folder has some trained models which can be used.
